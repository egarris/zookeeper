# Zookeeper

This is the 6th project--more of a short exercise--that I completed as part of JetBrains Academy's Python Developer track. It was *very* basic.

From the project's description (https://hyperskill.org/projects/98?track=2):

"This short code challenge can help the local zoo look after its denizens. You will create a tool for monitoring animals and their status."

Topics covered include:
- Python basics
